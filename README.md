Wordpress Starter Theme

This is a Wordpress Starter Theme I've made to start with a webpack setup and a clean theme.
All configs can be found in webpack.mix.js.
This theme also include a react compilation for wordpress custom gutenberg blocks.

To get started in your terminal do:
>npm install

To run live-server do:
>npm watch

To compile file for production do:
>npm prod
